Download data from:

    EOBS => Copernicus Climate Data Store (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).
    SMILES => Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) nodes (https://esgf.llnl.gov/nodes.html).

Data processing with CDO (scripts in 0_cdo_files).

    For t2max and mrso: individual files are merged, regridded to MPI-GE grid, and the European domain is selected.
    For global mean temperatures (GMT): individual tas files are merged and the weighted area average is computed.

Identifying heatwave days and computing their intensity (the core scripts for identifying heatwaves are located in "core_code"):

    We compute two sets of t2max anomalies.

    "anomaly_t2max" for non-detrended data: compute t2max anomalies to deseasonalize data.
    "anomaly_t2max_detrended" for detrended data: compute detrended t2max anomalies to deseasonalize data and remove the ensemble mean trend.

    Compute heatwave threshold: 90th percentile based on a centered 15-day running window and 1985-2014 reference period.
    Identify heatwave days: t2max exceeding the threshold for at least 6 consecutive days.
    Compute cumulative heat.
    Integrate cumulative heat for summer months (JJA) and European domain.

Scripts for the regression analysis and figures: "2_analysis_paper".
